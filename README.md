# My Docker-Compose Collection

Welcome to my collection of Docker Compose files! Here you'll find a variety of setups for popular services, including web servers, databases, and more.

## What's Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to specify the services that make up your application in a single file, and then start and stop them all with a single command.

## How to Use These Compose Files

To use these compose files, simply clone this repository to your local machine and then run the `docker-compose up` command in the directory containing the compose file you're interested in. This will start all the services defined in the compose file, and you'll be able to access them in your browser or via the command line.
